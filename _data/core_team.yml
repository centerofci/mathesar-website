    "My husband and I use a database-backed application to **track movies**. Movies we own, movies we want to watch, movies we’ve watched.
    
    I had to write a bunch of code for it, but it would have been much faster to build it using Mathesar – if it had existed!"

    "I'm using a database (and planning to use Mathesar) to store and analyze info I collect about various countries. e.g. cost of living, tax rates, population statistics, economic statistics, etc.
    
    I'm tentatively calling it the **Country Comparator**."

    "I use calculators **for MMORPG games**, to find the most efficient item to use for doing something in the game. 
    
    Since the game has a real-time market, a relational database is really useful for reflecting the price changes across a lot of calculators."

    "Mathesar would be great for **scraping and reporting**. For example, I scraped a poorly-done government website for making appointments with doctors. That allowed me to query reservation slots, watch for cancellations, and book a consultation much earlier than I otherwise could have."
